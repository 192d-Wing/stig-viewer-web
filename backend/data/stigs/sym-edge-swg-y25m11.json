Lack of authentication enables anyone to gain access to the network or possibly a network element that provides opportunity for intruders to compromise resources within the network infrastructure. By identifying and authenticating nonorganizational users, their access to network resources can be restricted accordingly. Nonorganizational users will be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization when related to the use of anonymous access. Authorization requires an individual account identifier that has been approved, assigned, and configured on an authentication server. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. This control applies to application layer gateways that provide content filtering and proxy services on network segments (e.g., DMZ) that allow access by nonorganizational users. This requirement focuses on authentication requests to the proxied application for access to destination resources and policy filtering decisions rather than administrator and management functions.

Before continuing, ensure that the Edge SWG was implemented for SYME-ND-000190. Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card and the DOD common access card (CAC). A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user. Remote access is access to DOD-nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. An example of compliance with this requirement is the use of a one-time password token and PIN coupled with a password; or the use of a CAC/PIV card and PIN coupled with a password.
