To meet this requirement, the information system must create trusted channels between itself and remote trusted authorized IT product (e.g., syslog server) entities that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications. The information system must create trusted paths between itself and remote administrators and users that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications. A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is most often used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. However, applications that do not use a trusted path are not approved for nonlocal and remote management of DOD information systems. Use of SSHv2 to establish a trusted channel is approved. Use of FTP, TELNET, HTTP, and SNMPV1 is not approved since they violate the trusted channel rule set. Use of web management tools that are not validated by common criteria my also violate trusted channel rule set. When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA. This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.

Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk. Currently, DOD requires the use of AES for bidirectional authentication since it is the only FIPS-validated AES cipher block algorithm. For distributed architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures), the decisions regarding the validation of authentication claims may be made by services separate from the services acting on those decisions. In such situations, it is necessary to provide authentication decisions (as opposed to the actual authenticators) to the services that need to act on those decisions. A local connection is any connection with a device communicating without the use of a network. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area or wide area network; the internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the internet). Because of the challenges of applying this requirement on a large scale, organizations are encouraged to apply the requirement only to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability.","fixText":"Submit a CSR for a DOD-issued certificate with the private key.\nRetrieve the approved certificate from the issuing Certificate Authority.\nSet the friendly name on the certificate to https.\n\nWindows-MY:\nOpen the Microsoft Management Console.\nAdd the Certificates Snap-In for the ISEC7 Service Account.\nNavigate to the Personal Certificates Store.\nImport the certificate with Private key.\nLog in to the ISEC7 SPHERE Console.\nNavigate to Administration >> Configuration >> Apache Tomcat Settings.\nSet the Keystore Type to Windows-MY.\nRestart the ISEC7 SPHERE Web service.\n\nJavaKeystore:\nUsing a Keystore browser such as Portecle, open the ISEC7 SPHERE Suite keystore.\nEnter the Keystore password when prompted.\nDelete the self-signed certificate in the keystore.\nImport the DOD-issued certificate with the private key.\nEnter the key password when prompted.\nEnter the certificate alias as \"https\" when prompted.\nSave the keystore with the same keystore password.\nLog in to the ISEC7 SPHERE Console.\nNavigate to Administration >> Configuration >> Apache Tomcat Settings.\nVerify the Keystore type is set to JavaKeystore PKCS12.\nRestart the ISEC7 SPHERE Web service.","checkText":"Log in to the ISEC7 SPHERE Console.\nConfirm that the browser session is secured using a DOD issued certificate. \nInternet Explorer:\nClick the Padlock icon at the end of the url field.\nSelect \"View Certificates\".\nConfirm that the Issued By is a valid DOD Certificate Authority.\n\nGoogle Chrome:\nClick the Padlock icon at the front of the url field.\nSelect \"Certificate\".\nConfirm that the Issued By is a valid DOD Certificate Authority.\n\nAlternately, log in to the ISEC7 SPHERE Console.\nNavigate to Administration >> Configuration >> Apache Tomcat Settings.\nIdentify which type of Keystore is being used.\n\nWindows MY: \nOpen the Microsoft Management Console.\nAdd the Certificates Snap-In for the ISEC7 Service Account.\nNavigate to the Personal Certificates Store.\nVerify the certificate is issued by a DOD Trusted Certificate Authority.\n\nJavaKeystore PKCS12:\nUsing a Keystore browser such as Portecle, open the ISEC7 SPHERE keystore.\nEnter the Keystore password when prompted.\nOpen the installed certificate and verify it was issued by a DOD Trusted Certificate Authority.\n\nIf certificates used by the server are not DOD-issued certificates, this is a finding.","cciIds":["SV-106503","V-97399","CCI-001967"],"status":"not_reviewed","findingDetails":"","comments":""},{"id":"SV-224771r1013827_rule","stigId":"V-224771","groupId":"V-224771","title":"DPMS Target ISEC7 Sphere","severity":"CAT II","description":"Untrusted Certificate Authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they may be issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise DOD systems or by organizations with insufficient security controls.

In general, pre-shared keys should not be used. However, the use of pre-shared keys may be appropriate for some closed environments that have stung key management best practices. Pre-shared keys may be appropriate for constrained environments with limited processing, memory, or power. If pre-shared keys are appropriate and supported, the following additional guidelines must be followed. Consult 800-52 for recommended pre-shared key cipher suites for pre-shared keys. Pre-shared keys must be distributed in a secure manner, such as a secure manual distribution or using a key establishment certificate. These cipher suites employ a pre-shared key for device authentication (for both the server and the client) and may also use RSA or ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) algorithms for key establishment. Because these cipher suites require pre-shared keys, these suites are not generally applicable to classic secure website applications and are not expected to be widely supported in TLS clients or TLS servers. NIST suggests that these suites be considered in particular for infrastructure applications, particularly if frequent authentication of the network entities is required. These cipher suites may be used with TLS versions 1.1 or 1.2. Note that cipher suites using GCM, SHA-256, or SHA-384 are only available in TLS 1.2. Using older unauthorized versions or incorrectly configuring protocol negotiation makes the gateway vulnerable to known and unknown attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in this protocol. This requirement applies to Transport Layer Security (TLS) gateways (also known as Secure Sockets Layer [SSL] gateways), web servers, and web applications. Application protocols such as HTTPS and DNSSEC use TLS as the underlying security protocol and thus are in scope for this requirement.

Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read and easily compromised. Use of passwords for authentication is intended only for limited situations and should not be used as a replacement for two-factor CAC-enabled authentication. Examples of situations where a user ID and password might be used include: - When the user does not use a CAC and is not a current DOD employee, member of the military, or DOD contractor. - When a user has been officially designated as temporarily unable to present a CAC for some reason (lost, damaged, not yet issued, broken card reader) (i.e., Temporary Exception User) and to satisfy urgent organizational needs must be temporarily permitted to use user ID/password authentication until the problem with CAC use has been remedied. - When the application is publicly available and or hosting publicly releasable data requiring some degree of need-to-know protection. If the password is already encrypted and not a plaintext password, this meets this requirement. Implementation of this requirement requires configuration of FIPS-approved cipher block algorithm and block cipher modes for encryption. This method uses a one-way hashing encryption algorithm with a salt value to validate a user's password without having to store the actual password. Performance and time required to access are factors that must be considered, and the one-way hash is the most feasible means of securing the password and providing an acceptable measure of password security. Verifying the user knows a password is performed using a password verifier. In its simplest form, a password verifier is a computational function that is capable of creating a hash of a password and determining if the value provided by the user matches the hash. A more secure version of verifying a user knowing a password is to store the result of an iterating hash function and a large random salt value as follows: H0 = H(pwd, H(salt)) Hn = H(Hn-1,H(salt)) In the above, \"n\" is a cryptographically-strong random [*3] number. \"Hn\" is stored along with the salt. When the application wishes to verify that the user knows a password, it simply repeats the process and compares \"Hn\" with the stored \"Hn\". A salt is essentially a fixed-length cryptographically strong random value. Another method is using a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC calculates a message authentication code via a cryptographic hash function used in conjunction with an encryption key. The key must be protected as with any private key. This requirement applies to all accounts including authentication server, AAA, and local account, including the root account and the account of last resort.","fixText":"To encrypt the Tomcat Manager Web app password, run the ISEC7 integrated installer or use the following manual procedure.\n\nNote: The ISEC7 integrated installer will configure SHA-512 as the hash algorithm, which is not available with the manual procedure.
