Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.","fixText":"Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to require a password for authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.  \n  \nGenerate an encrypted (grub) password for root by using the following command:  \n  \n     $ grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2  \n     Enter Password:  \n     Reenter Password: \n     PBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.03255F190F0E2F7B4F0D1C3216012309162F022A7A636771 \n  \nUsing the hash from the output, modify the \"/etc/grub.d/40_custom\" file by using the following command to add a boot password:  \n  \n     $ sudo sed -i '$i set superusers=\\\"root\\\"\\npassword_pbkdf2 root <hash>' /etc/grub.d/40_custom  \n  \nwhere <hash> is the hash generated by grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 command.  \n  \nGenerate an updated \"grub.conf\" file with the new password by using the following command:  \n  \n     $ sudo update-grub","checkText":"Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS requires a password for authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes by using the following command:  \n  \n     $ sudo grep -i password /boot/grub/grub.cfg  \n  \n     password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.03255F190F0E2F7B4F0D1C3216012309162F022A7A636771 \n  \nIf the root password entry does not begin with \"password_pbkdf2\", this is a finding.","cciIds":["CCI-000213"],"status":"not_reviewed","findingDetails":"","comments":""},{"id":"SV-260471r1155214_rule","stigId":"V-260471","groupId":"V-260471","title":"DPMS Target Canonical Ubuntu 22.04 LTS","severity":"CAT II","description":"If auditing is enabled late in the startup process, the actions of some startup processes may not be audited.

Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For nonkernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a certification authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the internet). The DOD common access card (CAC) with DOD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.","fixText":"Enable the \"sssd.service to start automatically on reboot with the following command: \n \n$ sudo systemctl enable sssd.service \n \nEnsure the \"sssd\" service is running:\n \n$ sudo systemctl start sssd.service","checkText":"Verify the \"sssd.service\" is enabled and active with the following commands: \n \n$ sudo systemctl is-enabled sssd\nenabled\n\n$ sudo systemctl is-active sssd\nactive\n\nIf \"sssd.service\" is not active or enabled, this is a finding.","cciIds":["CCI-004046","CCI-004047","CCI-000765","CCI-000766"],"status":"not_reviewed","findingDetails":"","comments":""},{"id":"SV-274867r1107270_rule","stigId":"V-274867","groupId":"V-274867","title":"DPMS Target Canonical Ubuntu 22.04 LTS","severity":"CAT II","description":"Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a certification authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA. This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses. Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.","fixText":"Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, for PKI-based authentication, to validate certificates by constructing a certification path to an accepted trust anchor. \n \nAdd or update the /etc/sssd/sssd.conf so that the following entries are in the correct sections of the file: \n \n$ sudo vi /etc/sssd/sssd.conf\n\n[sssd]\nservices = nss,pam,ssh\nconfig_file_version = 2\n\n[pam]\npam_cert_auth = True\n\n[domain/example.com]\nldap_user_certificate = usercertificate;binary\ncertificate_verification = ca_cert,ocsp\nca_cert = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt","checkText":"Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, for PKI-based authentication, has valid certificates by constructing a certification path to an accepted trust anchor. \n\nVerify the pam service is listed under [sssd] with the following command:\n\n$ sudo grep -A 1 '^\\[sssd\\]' /etc/sssd/sssd.conf\n[sssd]\nservices = nss,pam,ssh\n\nIf \"pam\" is not listed in services, this is a finding.\n\nVerify the pam service is set to use pam for smart card authentication in the [pam] section of /etc/sssd/sssd.conf with the following command:\n\n$ sudo grep -A 1 '^\\[pam]' /etc/sssd/sssd.conf\n[pam]\npam_cert_auth = True\n\nIf \"pam_cert_auth = True\" is not returned, this is a finding.\n\nVerify \"ca\" is enabled in \"certificate_verification\" with the following command: \n  \n$ sudo grep certificate_verification /etc/sssd/sssd.conf\ncertificate_verification = ca_cert,ocsp\n \nIf \"certificate_verification\" is not set to \"ca\" or the line is commented out, this is a finding.","cciIds":["CCI-000185","CCI-004909"],"status":"not_reviewed","findingDetails":"","comments":""},{"id":"SV-278951r1155215_rule","stigId":"V-278951","groupId":"V-278951","title":"DPMS Target Canonical Ubuntu 22.04 LTS","severity":"CAT I","description":"An operating system release is considered \"supported\" if the vendor continues to provide security patches for the product.
