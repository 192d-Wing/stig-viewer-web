Remote access methods include both unencrypted and encrypted traffic (e.g., web portals, web content filter, TLS, and webmail). With inbound TLS inspection, the traffic must be inspected prior to being allowed on the enclave's web servers hosting TLS or HTTPS applications. With outbound traffic inspection, traffic must be inspected prior to being forwarded to destinations outside of the enclave, such as external email traffic. This requirement does not mandate the decryption and inspection of SSL/TLS; it requires that if this is performed in the device, the decrypted traffic be inspected and conform to security policies. If SSL/TLS traffic is decrypted in the device, it must be inspected. The Palo Alto Networks security platform can be configured to decrypt and inspect SSL/TLS connections going through the device. With SSL Decryption, SSL-encrypted traffic is decrypted and App-ID and the Antivirus, Vulnerability, Anti-Spyware, URL Filtering, and File-Blocking Profiles can be applied to decrypted traffic before being re-encrypted and being forwarded. This is not limited to SSL encrypted HTTP traffic (HTTPS); other protocols \"wrapped\" in SSL/TLS can be decrypted and inspected. Decryption is policy-based and can be used to decrypt, inspect, and control both inbound and outbound SSL and SSH connections. Decryption policies allow the administrator to specify traffic for decryption according to destination, source, or URL category and in order to block or restrict the specified traffic according to security settings.","fixText":"Note: These instructions assume that certificates have already been loaded on the device.

Phone home traffic must either be blocked or intercepted by the DNS Sinkholing feature.

This is a common practice in \"botnets\", which are a collection of compromised computers using malware to attack (usually DDoS) other computers or networks. DDoS attacks frequently leverage IP source address spoofing, in which packets with false source IP addresses send traffic to multiple hosts, who then send return traffic to the hosts with the IP addresses that were forged. This can generate significant, even massive, amounts of traffic. Therefore, protection measures to counteract IP source address spoofing must be taken. Enclaves must enforce egress filtering. In egress filtering, packets leaving the enclave are discarded if the source IP address is not part of the IP address network(s), also known as prefixes, which are assigned to the enclave. A more specific form of egress filtering is to allow only those hosts and protocols that have been identified and authorized to exit the enclave. All traffic leaving the enclave, regardless of the destination, must be filtered by the premise router's egress filter to verify that the source IP address belongs to the enclave. Configure a security policy that allows only traffic originating from the IP address prefixes assigned to the enclave to exit the enclave. The implicit deny cross zone traffic rule will then be used, in part, to deny illegitimate source address traffic originating from an internal zone to go to another zone.","fixText":"Create an anti-spoofing policy for each outgoing zone that drops any traffic when the source IP does not match the list of allowed IP ranges for each outgoing zone.\n\nNavigate to the “Zone Protection Profile” configuration screen.\n\nSelect the “Packet- Based Attack Protection” tab.\n\nSelect the “IP Drop” tab.\n\nCheck the “Spoofed IP Address” box.","checkText":"Verify an anti-spoofing policy is configured for each outgoing zone that drops any traffic when the source IP does not match the list of allowed IP ranges for each outgoing zone.\n\nNavigate to the “Zone Protection Profile” configuration screen\n\nSelect the “Packet-Based Attack Protection” tab\n\nSelect the “IP Drop” tab\n\nIf the “Spoofed IP Address” box is not checked for each outgoing zone, this is a finding.","cciIds":["SV-77061","V-62571","CCI-001094"],"status":"not_reviewed","findingDetails":"","comments":""},{"id":"SV-228845r557387_rule","stigId":"V-228845","groupId":"V-228845","title":"DPMS Target Palo Alto Networks ALG","severity":"CAT II","description":"A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those connections that are essential and approved are allowed.

These attacks include zero-day attacks that are new attacks for which vendors have not yet developed signatures. Rate-based behavior analysis can detect sophisticated, Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks by correlating traffic information from multiple network segments or components.

This type of monitoring allows for the detection of known and unknown exploits that exploit weaknesses of commonly used protocols. The device must be configured to inspect inbound and outbound HTTP communications traffic to detect protocol anomalies such as malformed message and command insertion attacks. All inbound and outbound traffic, including HTTPS, must be inspected. However, the intention of this policy is not to mandate HTTPS inspection by the device. Typically, HTTPS traffic is inspected either at the source, destination, and/or is directed for inspection by an organization-defined network termination point.","fixText":"If HTTP is authorized, configure a security policy to allow it and inspect it.\nGo to Policies >> Security\nSelect \"Add\" to create a new security policy or select the name of the security policy to edit it.\nIn the \"Security Policy Rule\" window, complete the required fields.\nIn the \"Name\" tab, complete the \"Name\" and \"Description\" fields.\nIn the \"Source\" tab, complete the \"Source Zone\" and \"Source Address\" fields.\nIn the \"User\" tab, complete the \"Source User\" and \"HIP Profile\" fields.\nIn the \"Destination\" tab, complete the \"Destination Zone\" and \"Destination Address\" fields.\nIn the \"Applications\" tab, either select the \"Any\" check box or add web-browsing.
