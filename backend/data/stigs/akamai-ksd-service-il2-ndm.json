Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their management session prior to vacating the vicinity, network devices need to be able to identify when a management session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock. Once invoked, the session lock must remain in place until the administrator reauthenticates. No other system activity aside from reauthentication must unlock the management session. When the network device is remotely administered, a session logoff may be the only practical option in lieu of a session lock. For a web portal, a session logoff must be invoked when idle time is exceeded for an administrator.
