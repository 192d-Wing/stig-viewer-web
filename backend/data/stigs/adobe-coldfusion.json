Allowing using non-FIPS-approved or outdated encryption modules increases the attack surface and exposes the system to known vulnerabilities.

This allows an attacker to decrypt sensitive data through man-in-the-middle techniques.

If access to CFIDE is not properly restricted, it can expose sensitive administrative interfaces and development tools to unauthorized users. This can lead to potential security breaches, including unauthorized access to the ColdFusion Administrator, exposure of sensitive configuration information, and the ability to execute arbitrary code. By blocking access to CFIDE in the uriworkermap.properties file, the ColdFusion server ensures that these critical resources are protected from unauthorized access. Regularly verifying and enforcing the blocking of CFIDE is essential for maintaining a secure server environment and preventing potential security vulnerabilities.","fixText":"Configure the \"uriworkermap.properties: file.\n\n1.

If these stores include unapproved or rogue trust anchors they introduce the risk of trusting malicious or compromised certificates. This can lead to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, spoofing of trusted services, or unauthorized data decryption. Only including approved trust anchors ensures that ColdFusion trusts only vetted entities for secure communications. This protects against the installation of unauthorized certificates that could be used to intercept or manipulate encrypted traffic. Maintaining strict control over which trust anchors are included in ColdFusion's trust and certificate stores is essential to upholding the integrity and confidentiality of system communications. It also ensures alignment with enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) policies and reduces the risk of inadvertently trusting a compromised or untrusted source.","fixText":"Configure connection.\n\nFor all untrusted certificates identified execute the following command:\nC:\\ColdFusion2023\\jre\\bin\\keytool -delete -alias \"<certificate alias>\" -keystore <keystorefile>","checkText":"Validate Connection.\n\n1.

The PMT agent collects, stores, and transmits detailed information about ColdFusion server activity, queries, and application behavior.

The PMT Agent Package increases the attack surface by adding additional components, services, and ports that must be secured, monitored, and patched. Improperly configured or unmonitored PMT agents could allow adversaries to gain insights into application internals, conduct reconnaissance, or pivot toward exploiting ColdFusion services.
