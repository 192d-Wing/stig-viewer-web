Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks. This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts. The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means. The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session. (Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)","fixText":"Create the stored procedure per organization guidelines to restrict the number of concurrent sessions using the CREATE or REPLACE procedure:\nDB2> CREATE or REPLACE   PROCEDURE <DBINST1.MY_CONNECT> (Example below.)\n\nUpdate the database CONNECT_PROC parameter to set to the procedure created in previous step:\n\n     $db2 update db cfg using CONNECT_PROC db2inst1.my_connect\n\nGrant execute to the public to connect the procedure.\nDB2> GRANT EXECUTE ON procedure <schema>.MY_CONNECT_MAIN TO PUBLIC\n\nNote:  This is an example.

A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization. A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage. The DBMS must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. Automation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.","fixText":"Create an IBMLDAPSecurity.ini file at the default name and location for the IBM LDAP security plug-in configuration file:\n\n    On UNIX/LINUX:  $INSTHOME/sqllib/cfg/IBMLDAPSecurity.ini\n    On Windows:  %DB2PATH%\\cfg\\IBMLDAPSecurity.ini\n\nTo create the file in a non-default location, set the environment variable DB2LDAPSecurityConfig to the directory name where configuration file IBMLDAPSecurity.ini is located. \n\nSet the value of SRVCON_PW_PLUGIN to IBMLDAPauthserver for instance by running the following command:\n\n     $db2 update dbm cfg using SRVCON_PW_PLUGIN IBMLDAPauthserver immediate\n\nRefer to details below to determine appropriate values in LDAP configuration file.\n\n-- SERVER-RELATED values:\n1) LDAP_HOST - The name of the LDAP server(s) - This is a space separated list of LDAP server host names or IP addresses, with an optional port number for each one. \n\nFor example: host1[:port1] [host2:[port2] ... The default port number is 389, or 636 if SSL is enabled.\n\n2) ENABLE_SSL - To enable SSL support, set ENABLE_SSL to TRUE (you must have the GSKit installed). This is an optional parameter; it defaults to FALSE (no SSL support).\n\n3) SSL_KEYFILE - The path for the SSL keyring. A keyfile is only required if your LDAP server is using a certificate that is not automatically trusted by your GSKit installation. \n\nFor example: SSL_KEYFILE = /home/db2inst1/IBMLDAPSecurity.kdb\n\n4) SSL_PW - The SSL keyring password. For example: SSL_PW = keyfile-password\n\n5) SECURITY_PROTOCOL - To enable TLS 1.2 support, set SECURITY_PROTOCOL to TLSV12. To enable TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 support, set SECURITY_PROTOCOL to ALL. \n\nBy default, SECURITY_PROTOCOL is not set. This setting means TLS 1.2 is not supported.\n\n-- USER_RELATED values:\n1) USER_OBJECTCLASS - The LDAP object class used for users. \n\nGenerally, set USER_OBJECTCLASS to inetOrgPerson (the user for Microsoft Active Directory) \n\nFor example: USER_OBJECTCLASS = inetOrgPerson\n\n2) USER_BASEDN -  The LDAP base DN to use when searching for users. If not specified, user searches start at the root of the LDAP directory. Some LDAP servers require that you specify a value for this parameter. \n\nFor example: USER_BASEDN = o=ibm\n\n3) USERID_ATTRIBUTE - The LDAP user attribute that represents the user ID. The USERID_ATTRIBUTE attribute is combined with the USER_OBJECTCLASS and USER_BASEDN (if specified) to construct an LDAP search filter when a user issues a DB2 CONNECT statement with an unqualified user ID. \n\nFor example, if USERID_ATTRIBUTE = uid, then issuing this statement: db2 connect to MYDB user bob using bobpass results in the following search filter:\n&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(uid=bob)\n\n4) AUTHID_ATTRIBUTE - The LDAP user attribute that represents the DB2 authorization ID. Usually this is the same as the USERID_ATTRIBUTE.\nFor example: AUTHID_ATTRIBUTE = uid\n\n-- GROUP-RELATED values: \n1) GROUP_OBJECTCLASS - The LDAP object class used for groups. Generally this is groupOfNames or groupOfUniqueNames\n(for Microsoft Active Directory, it is group)\n\nFor example: GROUP_OBJECTCLASS = groupOfNames\n\n2) GROUP_BASEDN - The LDAP base DN to use when searching for groups If not specified, group searches start at the root of the LDAP directory. Some LDAP servers require that you specify a value for this parameter.\n\nFor example: GROUP_BASEDN = o=ibm\n\n3) GROUPNAME_ATTRIBUTE - The LDAP group attribute that represents the name of the group.\n\nFor example: GROUPNAME_ATTRIBUTE = cn\n\n4) GROUP_LOOKUP_ METHOD - Determines the method used to find the group memberships for a user. \nPossible values are:\nSEARCH_BY_DN Indicates to search for groups that list the user as a member. Membership is indicated by the group attribute defined as GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE (typically, member or uniqueMember). \n\nUSER_ATTRIBUTE In this case, a user's groups are listed as attributes of the user object itself. This setting indicates to search for the user attribute defined as GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE to get the user's groups (typically memberOf for Microsoft Active Directory or ibm-allGroups for IBM Tivoli Directory Server).\n\nFor example: GROUP_LOOKUP_METHOD = SEARCH_BY_DN\nGROUP_LOOKUP_METHOD = USER_ATTRIBUTE\n\n5) GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE - Name of the attribute used to determine group membership, as described for GROUP_LOOKUP_METHOD.\n\nFor example:\nGROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE = member\nGROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE = ibm-allGroups\nNESTED_GROUPS If NESTED_GROUPS is TRUE, the DB2 database manager recursively searches for group membership by attempting to look up the group memberships for every group that is found.\n\nCycles (such as A belongs to B, and B belongs to A) are handled correctly.\nThis parameter is optional, and defaults to FALSE.\n\n-- MISCELLANEOUS  values:\n1) SEARCH_DN, SEARCH_PW If your LDAP server does not support anonymous access, or if anonymous access is not sufficient when searching for users or groups, then you can optionally define a DN and password that will be used to perform searches.\n\nFor example:\nSEARCH_DN = cn=root\nSEARCH_PW = rootpassword\n\n2) DEBUG  Set DEBUG to TRUE to write extra information to the db2diag log files to aid in debugging LDAP related issues.\n\nMost of the additional information is logged at\nDIAGLEVEL 4 (INFO).\nDEBUG defaults to false.","checkText":"The default name and location for the IBM LDAP security plug-in configuration file is:\n\nOn UNIX/LINUX: INSTHOME/sqllib/cfg/IBMLDAPSecurity.ini\n\nOn Windows: %DB2PATH%\\cfg\\IBMLDAPSecurity.ini\n\nIf the IBMLDAPSecurity.ini  file does not exist in the default location and environment variable DB2LDAPSecurityConfig  is not set, this is a finding. \n\nIf the environment variable DB2LDAPSecurityConfig is set and file does not exist in DB2LDAPSecurityConfig location, this is a finding. \n\nFind the value of SRVCON_PW_PLUGIN by running \n\n     $db2 get dbm cfg\n\nIf SRVCON_PW_PLUGIN is not set to IBMLDAPauthserver, this is a finding. \n\nNote:\nIn Windows, find the location of base installation directory of DB2 using one of following methods\n1.

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If the DBMS does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.","fixText":"If a privilege is granted directly to PUBLIC, revoke it using the appropriate variation of the REVOKE statement specific to the object on which the privilege is granted.

In designing a database, the organization must define the types of data and the user actions that must be protected from repudiation.

When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures: -- Allow strings as input only when necessary. -- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted. -- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary. -- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them. -- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ -- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them. -- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use. -- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input. -- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits. -- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer. -- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use. -- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation. -- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways.
