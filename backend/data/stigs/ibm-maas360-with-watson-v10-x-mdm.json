The non-bracketed text below must be used without any changes as the warning banner. [A. Use this banner for desktops, laptops, and other devices accommodating banners of 1300 characters. The banner shall be implemented as a click-through banner at logon (to the extent permitted by the operating system), meaning it prevents further activity on the information system unless and until the user executes a positive action to manifest agreement by clicking on a box indicating “OK.”] You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.
