Session locks can be implemented at the operating system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be used to initiate the session lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled session or dongle). User-initiated session locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such, requires users to take physical action to initiate the session lock. Session locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems, such as when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000295","fixText":"1.

Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. Applications need to track periods of user inactivity and disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be hijacked, leading to a data compromise. To address access requirements, many application developers choose to integrate their applications with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the application developer to offload those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality. This policy does not apply to either emergency accounts or infrequently used accounts. Infrequently used accounts are local login administrator accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available. Emergency accounts are administrator accounts created in response to crisis situations.
