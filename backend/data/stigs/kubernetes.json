Not updating the Kubernetes control plane will expose the organization to vulnerabilities. Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant container platform components may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the IAVM process. The container platform components will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The container platform registry will ensure the images are current.

The main implementation of the API Server is to manage hardware resources for pods and container using horizontal or vertical scaling. Anyone who can gain access to the API Server can effectively control your Kubernetes architecture. Using authenticity protection, the communication can be protected against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions. The communication session is protected by utilizing transport encryption protocols, such as TLS. TLS provides the Kubernetes API Server with a means to be able to authenticate sessions and encrypt traffic. By default, the API Server does not authenticate to the kubelet HTTPs endpoint. To enable secure communication for API Server, the parameter -kubelet-client-certificate and kubelet-client-key must be set.
