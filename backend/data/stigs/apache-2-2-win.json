It can choose the best representation of a resource based on the browser-supplied preferences for media type, languages, character set and encoding. It also implements a couple of features to give more intelligent handling of requests from browsers that send incomplete negotiation information. Content negotiation, or more accurately content selection, is the selection of the document that best matches the clients capabilities, from one of several available documents. There are two implementations of this. • A type map (a file with the handler type-map) which explicitly lists the files containing the variants. • A Multiviews search (enabled by the Multiviews Options), where the server does an implicit filename pattern match, and choose from amongst the results. A MultiViews search is where the server does an implicit filename pattern match, and chooses from the results. For example, if you have a file called configuration.php (or other extension) in root folder and you set up a rule in your htaccess for a virtual folder called configuration/ then you'll have a problem with your rule because the server will choose configuration.php automatically if MultiViews is enabled.
