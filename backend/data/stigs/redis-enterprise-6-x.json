Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks. This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts. The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means. The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session. (Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)","fixText":"To modify the number of maximum sessions, run the following command:\n\nrladmin tune db <db_name> max_connections <number_of_connections>\ne.g., - rladmin tune db inline-jp-staging max_connections 15000","checkText":"Redis sets this limit by default at 10k clients per shard.

If the max connections are greater than the organizationally defined value, this is a finding.\n\nNote: Redis Enterprise 6 does support multiple users; however, it does not support the ability to limit connections per user.

A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization. A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to act on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage. The DBMS must be configured to automatically use organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. Automation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.","fixText":"Integrate Redis Enterprise with LDAP to provide organization-level authentication/access mechanism and account management for all users, groups, roles, and any other principals.\n\nFor each DBMS-managed account that is not documented and approved, either transfer it to management by the external mechanism or document the need for it and obtain approval as appropriate.\n\nTo enable LDAP:\n1.

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If the DBMS does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.","fixText":"To modify the commands or keys a user is able to access, perform the following steps:\n\n1.

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged. Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users. A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: CREATE ALTER DROP GRANT REVOKE DENY There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include: TRUNCATE TABLE; DELETE, or DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or DELETE without a WHERE clause; UPDATE or UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or UPDATE without a WHERE clause; any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal. Depending on the capabilities of the DBMS and the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.

For this purpose, RS uses transport layer security (TLS) protocol, which is the more secure successor to SSL.\n\nTo enable TLS, the RS cluster nodes, the database, and  client must be configured as detailed below.\n\nConfiguration of the RS nodes:\nBy default, each cluster node has a different set of self-signed certificates. These certificates can be replaced with another certificate, preferably a certificate issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA).\n\nConfiguration of the database:\nTo encrypt the connection to the database endpoint with TLS, enter the contents the client certificate to the TLS field.\nNote: Once TLS encryption is enabled for the database endpoint, the database does not accept unsecured connections. TLS encryption can significantly impact database throughput and latency.\n\nAdding TLS CA signed certificates to the proxy:\nThe proxy is responsible for terminating the TLS connection.\nServer certificate and key are located on /etc/opt/redislabs:proxy_cert.pem - server certificate thatproxy_key.pem - server certificate key*any update on these requires a proxy restart\n\nEnabling of TLS is done via \"ssl authentication\" field in the UI. It is a requirement to add a client-side certificate as a TLS connection is done via client certificate authentication (not just server-side authentication).\n\nInstalling CA signed certificates high-level steps: \n1. Replace the RS server certificates and key on all nodes with the CA signed certificate and restart the proxy.\nNote: A certificate for the databases' endpoint should be assigned for the same domain as the cluster name. For example, for a cluster with the name \"redislabs.com\" the certificate should be for \"*.redislabs.com\".\n\n2. Add the TLS client certificates in the UI including CA certificates and any intermediate certificates by chaining the certificate into one file (use a cat command to chain the certificates).\n\n3. On the client side, import and trust the CA and intermediate certificates (chain the CA certificate with intermediate as one file to use and import).\n\nClient configuration:\nTo connect to a database configured with TLS encryption, either use one of the Redis clients that inherently support SSL encryption, or use any Redis client and create a secured tunnel between the client machine and the RS nodes.\n\nTo create a secure tunnel between the client machine and the RS nodes, use tools that enable this functionality, such as spiped or stunnel. An example of how to use stunnel is detailed below.\n\nNote: For security reasons, RS supports only the TLS protocol. Therefore, make sure the Redis client or secured tunnel solution used supports TLS, preferably TLS v1.2.\n\nWhen using self-signed certificates on the cluster nodes, make sure to copy these certificates to the client machines as well, thereby enabling the client to validate the cluster nodes.\n\nWhen using a certificate issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA) on the cluster nodes, make sure that the CA root certificate is installed on the client machines.\n\nExample how to secure client connection with TLS using stunnel: \nThe instructions below explain how to use stunnel for setting up a secure tunnel between a client machine and the RS nodes when the client is running on Ubuntu, using the default RS nodes' self-signed certificates, and a self-signed certificate on the client machine.\n\n1. Install stunnel version 5 or higher on the client machine. Older versions of stunnel do not support the TLS protocol.\n\n2. Create a self-signed certificate on the client machine.  \n\n3. Generate a private key by running the following commands:\nsudo su\nopenssl genrsa -out /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem 4096\n\n4. Generate a client certificate by running the following commands:\nopenssl req -new -x509 -key /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem\n-out\n/etc/stunnel/cert.pem -days 1826\n\n5. When prompted, enter the appropriate configuration details for the certificate.\n\n6. Copy the RS node certificates from all nodes to the client machine. The certificates are saved in a file named proxy_cert.pem, which is stored in /etc/opt/redislabs in each node.\n\n7. Rename the certificate files fetched from the RS nodes as certsvr.pem. For example: certsvr1.pem, certsvr2.pem.\n\n8. Create a single file for all of the server certificates on the client machine, by running the following command from the OS CLI. For example:\ncat /etc/stunnel/certsvr1.pem /etc/stunnel/certsvr2.pem > /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem\n\n9. Configure stunnel for the connection to RS by using the steps below:\n\n10. Create a redislabs.conf file in /etc/stunnel folder.\n\n11. Make sure the certificates that have been generated exist in the following folder: /etc/stunnel.\n\n12. Edit the redislabs.conf content to look as follows: \ncert = /etc/stunnel/cert.pem key = /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem cafile = /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem verify = 2 delay = yes output = /tmp/stunnel.log pid = /tmp/stunnel.pid[redislabs] client = yes accept = [server IP address]:[configured port] connect = [database endpoint value]\nWhere [database endpoint value] is the database endpoint as can be retrieved from RS.\n\nNote: The value for the accept parameter is the local IP and port that is used for redirecting the traffic through the secure tunnel to the database endpoint configured in the connect parameter.\n\n13. Copy the contents of the client certificate from cert.pem and enter them in the SSL Client Authentication field, in the RS UI, of the database to be secured. When done, be sure to save the change.\n\n14. Start the stunnel service by running the following command: service stunnel restart\n\nNote: Any change made to the stunnel configuration requires restarting the stunnel service.\n\n15. Check the stunnel log file to verify that the connection is working properly. The log file is created under the root folder within the configuration mentioned above.\n\n16. Test the connection to the Redis database from the client machine. Use Redis-cli to run commands on the client machine, and the commands are redirected from the local machine's port [configured port] to the RS database endpoint. Note the connection to the Redis database is done through the local port; do not try to connect directly to the database endpoint.\n\nTLS version information: \nTo set the minimum TLS version that can be used for encrypting the data in transit between a Redis client and a Redis Enterprise cluster, use the REST API or the following rladmin command:\nrladmin> cluster config min_data_TLS_version [version, e.g., 1.2]\n\nNote that if a client supports an older TLS version, the communication is not allowed.","checkText":"Redis Enterprise Software (RS) can use industry-standard encryption to protect data in transit between a Redis client and RS.

Databases must fail to a known consistent state. Transactions must be successfully completed or rolled back. All data is stored and managed exclusively in either RAM or RAM + Flash Memory (Redis on Flash) and therefore, is at risk of being lost upon a process or server failure. As Redis Enterprise Software is not just a caching solution, but also a full-fledged database, persistence to disk is critical. Therefore, Redis Enterprise Software supports persisting data to disk on a per-database basis. Append Only File (AOF) is a continuous writing of data to disk Snapshot. It is not a replacement for backups but should be done in addition to backups. AOF writes the latest \"write\" commands into a file either every second or during every write. It resembles a traditional RDBMS's redo log. This file can later be replayed to recover from a crash. To ensure data availability, Redis Enterprise Software must be implemented in, at a minimum, a three-node cluster. A three-node cluster can withstand one node failure without data loss. If more than one node is lost in a three-node cluster and persistence is not enabled, then data loss is to be expected. The Append Only File is a persistence mode that provides much better durability. For instance, using the default data fsync policy, Redis can lose just one second of writes in a dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something goes wrong with the Redis process itself, but the operating system is still running correctly. AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems. If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file with the better durability guarantees.

The easiest way to encrypt a partition is during installation time.\n\nFor manual installations, select the \"Encrypt\" checkbox during partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots.\n\nFor automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding the \"--encrypted\" and \"--passphrase=\" options to the definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:\n\npart / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=[PASSPHRASE]\n\nAny [PASSPHRASE] is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly.

For this purpose, RS uses transport layer security (TLS) protocol, which is the more secure successor to SSL.\n\nTo enable TLS, the RS cluster nodes, the database, and client must be configured as detailed below.\n\nConfiguration of the RS nodes:\nBy default, each cluster node has a different set of self-signed certificates. These certificates can be replaced with another certificate, preferably a certificate issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA).\n\nConfiguration of the database:\nTo encrypt the connection to the database endpoint with TLS, enter the contents the client certificate to the TLS field.\nNote: Once TLS encryption is enabled for the database endpoint, the database does not accept unsecured connections. TLS encryption can significantly impact database throughput and latency.\n\nAdding TLS CA signed certificates to the proxy:\nThe proxy is responsible for terminating the TLS connection.\nServer certificate and key are located on /etc/opt/redislabs:proxy_cert.pem - server certificate thatproxy_key.pem - server certificate key*any update on these requires a proxy restart\n\nEnabling of TLS is done via the \"ssl authentication\" field in the UI. It is a requirement to add a client-side certificate as a TLS connection via client certificate authentication (not just server-side authentication).\n\nInstalling CA signed certificates:\nReplace the RS server certificates and key on all nodes with the CA signed certificate and restart the proxy.\nNote: A certificate for the databases' endpoint should be assigned for the same domain as the cluster name. For example, for a cluster with the name \"redislabs.com\" the certificate should be for \"*.redislabs.com\".\n\nAdd the TLS client certificates in the UI including CA certificates and any intermediate certificates by chaining the certificate into one file (use a cat command to chain the certificates).\nOn the client side make sure to import and trust the CA and intermediate certificates (chain the CA certificate with intermediate as one file to use and import).\n\nClient configuration:\nTo connect to a database configured with TLS encryption, either use one of the Redis clients that inherently support SSL encryption, or use any Redis client and create a secured tunnel between the client machine and the RS nodes.\n\nTo create a secure tunnel between the client machine and the RS nodes, use tools that enable this functionality, such as spiped or stunnel. An example of how to use stunnel is detailed below.\nNote: For security reasons, RS supports only the TLS protocol. Therefore, make sure that the Redis client or secured tunnel solution used supports TLS, preferably TLS v1.2.\n\nWhen using self-signed certificates on the cluster nodes, make sure to copy these certificates to the client machines as well, thereby enabling the client to validate the cluster nodes.\n\nWhen using a certificate issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA) on the cluster nodes, make sure that the CA root certificate is installed on the client machines.\n\nExample of how to secure client connection with TLS using stunnel: \nThe instructions below explain how to use stunnel for setting up a secure tunnel between a client machine and the RS nodes when the client is running on Ubuntu, using the default RS nodes' self-signed certificates, and a self-signed certificate on the client machine.\n\n1. Install stunnel version 5 or higher on the client machine. Older versions of stunnel do not support the TLS protocol.\n\n2. Create a self-signed certificate on the client machine:\n\n3. Generate a private key by running the following commands:\nsudo su\nopenssl genrsa -out /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem 4096\n\n4. Generate a client certificate by running the following commands:\nopenssl req -new -x509 -key /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem\n-out\n/etc/stunnel/cert.pem -days 1826\n\n5. When prompted, enter the appropriate configuration details for the certificate.\n\n6. Copy the RS node certificates from all nodes to the client machine. The certificates are saved in a file named proxy_cert.pem, which is stored in /etc/opt/redislabs in each node.\n\n7. Rename the certificate files fetched from the RS nodes as certsvr.pem. For example: certsvr1.pem, certsvr2.pem.\n\n8. Create a single file for all of the server certificates on the client machine by running the following command from the OS CLI. For example: cat /etc/stunnel/certsvr1.pem /etc/stunnel/certsvr2.pem > /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem\n\n9. Configure stunnel for the connection to RS by using the steps below:\n\n10. Create a redislabs.conf file in /etc/stunnel folder.\n\n11. Make sure that the certificates that have been generated exist in the following folder: /etc/stunnel.\n\n12. Edit the redislabs.conf content to look as follows:cert = /etc/stunnel/cert.pem key = /etc/stunnel/keyclient.pem cafile = /etc/stunnel/servercerts.pem verify = 2 delay = yes output = /tmp/stunnel.log pid = /tmp/stunnel.pid[redislabs] client = yes accept = [server IP address]:[configured port] connect = [database endpoint value] Where [database endpoint value] is the database endpoint as can be retrieved from RS.\n\nNote: The value for the accept parameter is the local IP and port that is used for redirecting the traffic through the secure tunnel to the database endpoint configured in the connect parameter.\n\n13. Copy the contents of the client certificate from cert.pem and enter them in the SSL Client Authentication field, in the RS UI, of the database to be secured. When done, be sure to save the change.\n\n14. Start the stunnel service by running the following command: service stunnel restart\n\nNote: Any change made to the stunnel configuration requires restarting the stunnel service.\n\n15. Check the stunnel log file to verify that the connection is working properly. The log file is created under the root folder within the configuration mentioned above.\n\n16. Test the connection to the Redis database from the client machine. Use redis-cli to run commands on the client machine, and the commands are redirected from the local machine's port [configured port] to the RS database endpoint. Note that the connection to the Redis database is done through the local port; do not try to connect directly to the database endpoint.\n\nTLS version information:\nTo set the minimum TLS version that can be used for encrypting the data in transit between a Redis client and a Redis Enterprise cluster, use the REST API or the following rladmin command:\nrladmin> cluster config min_data_TLS_version [version, e.g., 1.2]\n\nNote that if a client supports an older TLS version, the communication is not be allowed.","checkText":"If the data owner does not have a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process, this is not a finding.\n\nIf Redis Enterprise DBMS, associated applications, and infrastructure do not employ protective measures against unauthorized disclosure and modification during reception, this is a finding.\n\nRedis Enterprise Software (RS) can use industry-standard encryption to protect data in transit between a Redis client and RS.

To upgrade the Redis Enterprise Software (RS) software on a cluster, upgrade each of the nodes and then upgrade each of the databases in the cluster.\n\n- To upgrade the cluster to v6.0, the cluster must first be on 5.4.0 or above and the databases must be running Redis 5.\n- To upgrade the cluster to v5.6, the cluster must first be on 5.0.2-30 or above.\n- To upgrade the cluster to v5.4, the cluster must first be on 5.0 or above.\n- To upgrade the cluster to v5.2, the cluster must first be on 4.5 or above.\n\nThe upgrade process for a Redis Enterprise Software cluster is \"ongoing\" when the nodes in the cluster have mixed versions. The upgrade is only considered complete when all of the nodes are upgraded to the new version.\n\nWARNING Using features from the newer version before all nodes are upgraded can produce unexpected results or cause failures in the cluster.\n\nUpgrading a node: \nUpgrading the software on a node requires installing the RS installation package on all of the machines on which RS is installed.\n\nWARNING: The master node must be upgraded before upgrading the other nodes. It is recommended to keep all nodes up until the upgrade is completed on all nodes. The node role is shown in the output of the rladmin status nodes command. The installation path and user cannot be changed during upgrade. Node upgrade fails if the SSL certificates were configured in version 5.0.2 or above by manually updating the certificates on the disk instead of updating them through the API. For assistance with this issue, contact Support.\n\nRun install.sh from the directory where the media was untarred just like what is done for a new installation. The software recognizes this is an upgrade and proceeds accordingly.\n\nAs with a new installation, user must sudo or be root to do the upgrade.\n\nTo upgrade a node, run:\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nThe node upgrade process restarts the services running RS, which causes a short interruption to connections to the proxy, node, and databases.\n\nWARNING: To ensure cluster and databases' availability, it is important to upgrade the nodes one by one, and not attempt to upgrade more than one node at a time. To make sure that the node is functioning properly, run rlcheck and rladmin status extra all on the node both before and after the upgrade.\n\nIf the RS management UI is open in the browser while upgrading the nodes, make sure to refresh the browser before trying to work with the UI again.\n\nUpgrading a database \nSome RS upgrades add support for new Redis versions. In these cases, Redis Labs recommends upgrading the databases to the new Redis version, although this is not mandatory because RS upgrades are backward compatible. RS also supports a mix of Redis database versions.\n\nRS always supports two Redis versions. By default, new Redis databases are created with the latest version, and existing databases get upgraded to the latest version according to the instructions detailed below. If there is a desire to change the default Redis version to the previous version supported, it is recommended to use the tune cluster default_redis_version command in the rladmin CLI and set it to the previous Redis version supported.\n\nTo determine whether the Redis database versions match the latest Redis version supported by RS:\nIn the rladmin CLI, run the status command. If the Redis version is not the latest supported, an indication appears in the command output next to the database's status.\n\nIn the Management UI, Navigate to the Cluster >> Configuration page. The page lists the latest Redis version supported.\n\nIf the Redis database versions are older than the version supported by RS, Redis Labs recommends upgrading the Redis databases.\n\nTo upgrade the database:\n- Ensure that all of the nodes in the RS cluster are upgraded. Databases cannot be upgraded before all of the nodes in the cluster are upgraded.\n- In the rladmin CLI on any node in the cluster, run this command for each database: \nrladmin upgrade db <database_name | database_ID>\n\nDuring the database upgrade process, the database is restarted. As a result:\nFor databases that have replication enabled, a failover is done before the master database restarts to make sure that there is no downtime.\n\nFor databases without replication but with persistence enabled, the database is unavailable during the restart because data is restored from the persistence file. The length of the downtime is different for each persistence option. For example, AOF usually takes longer than an RDB file.\n\nFor databases that have neither replication nor persistence enabled, the database loses all its data after it is restarted.\n\nUpgrading Active-Active databases \nWhen upgrading an Active-Active (CRDB) database, the following may also be upgraded:\n\nProtocol version - RS 5.4.2 and higher include a new CRDB protocol version to support new Active-Active features. The CRDB protocol is backward-compatible so that RS 5.4.2 CRDB instances can understand write-operations that come from instances with the older CRDB protocol, but CRDB instances with the older protocol cannot understand write-operations of instances with the newer protocol version. As a result, after upgrading the CRDB protocol on one instance, instances that were not upgraded yet cannot receive write updates from the upgraded instance. The upgraded instance receives updates from upgraded and non-upgraded instances.\n\nNote: Upgrade all instances of a specific CRDB within a reasonable time frame to avoid temporary inconsistencies between the instances. Make sure that  all instances of a specific CRDB are upgraded before performing global operations on the CRDB, such as removing instances and adding new instances.\n\nAfter upgrading an instance to use the new protocol version, it automatically receives any missing write-operations.\n\nFeature set version: RS 5.6.0 and higher include a new feature set version to support new Active-Active features. When updating the feature set version for an Active-Active database, the feature set version is updated for all of the database instances.\n\nTo upgrade a CRDB instance:\nUpgrade RS on each node in the clusters where the CRDB instances are located.\n\nTo confirm the status of the CRDB instances, run: rladmin status\n\nThe statuses of the CRDB instances on the node can indicate:\nOLD REDIS VERSION\nOLD CRDB PROTOCOL VERSION\nOLD CRDB FEATURESET VERSION\ncrdb-upgrade-node\n\nTo upgrade each CRDB instance including the Redis version and CRDB protocol version, run:\nrladmin upgrade db <database_name | database_ID>\n\nIf the protocol version is old, read the warning message carefully and confirm. crdb-upgrade-protocol\n\nThe CRDB instance uses the new Redis version and CRDB protocol version.\n\nTo upgrade the CRDB instance without upgrading the protocol version:\nIf the feature set version is old, all of the CRDB instances must be upgraded. Then, to update the feature set for each active-active database, run:\ncrdb-cli crdb update --crdb-guid <CRDB-GUID> --featureset-version yes\n\nRetrieve the <CRDB-GUID> with the following command:\ncrdb-cli crdb list\n\nLook for the fully qualified domain name (CLUSTER-FDQN) of the cluster and use the associated GUID.","checkText":"To determine the current version of the software, perform the steps below:\n\n1.
