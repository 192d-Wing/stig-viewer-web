A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization. A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in noncentralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example, using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage. Azure SQL Managed Instance must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. Automation may comprise differing technologies, that when placed together, contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.","fixText":"If mixed mode is required, document the need and justification; describe the measures taken to ensure the use of Azure SQL Managed Instance authentication is kept to a minimum; describe the measures taken to safeguard passwords; list or describe the SQL logins used; and obtain official approval.  \n\nIf mixed mode is not required, for each account being managed by SQL MI but not requiring it, drop or disable the SQL Database user.

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If Azure SQL Managed Instance does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.","fixText":"Use GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, ALTER SERVER ROLE … ADD MEMBER … and/or ALTER SERVER ROLE … DROP MEMBER statements to add and remove permissions on server-level securables, bringing them in line with the documented requirements.  \n\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/revoke-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-current Deny:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/deny-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-current DROP MEMBER:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-droprolemember-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-current","checkText":"Review the system documentation to determine the required levels of protection for Azure SQL Managed Instance server securables, by type of login.  \n\nReview the permissions actually in place on the server.\n  \nExecute the supplemental \"DatabasePermissions.sql\" script to find permissions in place on the server. \n\nIf the actual permissions do not match the documented requirements, this is a finding.","cciIds":["CCI-000213"],"status":"not_reviewed","findingDetails":"","comments":""},{"id":"SV-276227r1149590_rule","stigId":"V-276227","groupId":"V-276227","title":"DPMS Target Microsoft Azure SQL Managed Instance","severity":"CAT II","description":"Within the database, object ownership implies full privileges to the owned object, including the privilege to assign access to the owned objects to other subjects.

It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. In such cases, the attacker deduces the manner in which SQL statements are being processed, either from inside knowledge or by observing system behavior in response to invalid inputs. When the attacker identifies scenarios where SQL queries are being assembled by application code (which may be within the database or separate from it) and executed dynamically, the attacker is then able to craft input strings that subvert the intent of the query. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database. The principal protection against code injection is not to use dynamic execution except where it provides necessary functionality that cannot be utilized otherwise. Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, precompiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers). When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which must be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures: - Allow strings as input only when necessary. - Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted. - Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary. - If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equal signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them. - If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ . - If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them. - If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word \"ESCAPE\" is also a clue that wildcards are in use. - If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly \"Grant\" (as a person's name), could also be valid input. - If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits. - Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer. - Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use. - Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation. - Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker. This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions. When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bound by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect.

This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application. With respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.
