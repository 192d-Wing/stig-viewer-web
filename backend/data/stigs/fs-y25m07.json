The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Many NACs include the ability to create network access control policies that include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. It is recommended that Forescout have the capability to expose collected data on the assessed endpoints through an API that can be accessed externally, or the NAC solution must supply an SDK to allow customers to export data. Admissions assessment filters should include, at a minimum, device attributes such as type, IP address, resource group, and/or mission conditions as defined in the Forescout SSP. Forescout should also track the following to facilitate security investigations: when each device was last admitted/readmitted to the network; owning organization; owning organization's organizational unit; geographic location or the nearest network switch; motherboard serial number and BIOS; globally unique ID; and which unique network access compliance policies each device passed or failed during the latest network admission/readmission. The client may be denied admission based on a returned posture token. In most Forescout implementations, additional network access authorization policies can also be tied to the user's identity, but these features are out of scope for this STIG.","fixText":"Use the Forescout Administrator UI to configure the endpoint compliance assessment policies per the SSP.

For example, unauthenticated devices must not be allowed to connect to remediation networks. Many sites block unauthorized traffic directly using the Forescout. Forescout accepts only endpoints with IP addresses that are in range. Configure Forescout to identify the endpoint. By default, the IP address is used as the endpoint identifier.

Set up a dedicated VLAN (e.g., \"Quarantine_VLAN\") for devices under assessment.\n2.

This type of attack lets an attacker exploit the hardware and memory limitations of a switch. If there are enough entries stored in a CAM table before the expiration of other entries, no new entries can be accepted into the CAM table. An attacker will be able to flood the switch with mostly invalid MAC addresses until the CAM table’s resources have been depleted. When there are no more resources, the switch has no choice but to flood all ports within the VLAN with all incoming traffic. This happens because the switch cannot find the switch port number for a corresponding MAC address within the CAM table, allowing the switch to become a hub and traffic to be monitored. Some technologies are exempt from requiring a single MAC address per access port; however, restrictions still apply. VoIP or VTC endpoints may provide a PC port so a PC can be connected. Each of the devices will need to be statically assigned to each access port. Hot-desking is where several people are assigned to work at the same desk at different times, each user with their own PC. In this case, a different MAC address needs to be permitted for each PC that is connecting to the LAN drop in the workspace. Additionally, this workspace could contain a single phone (and possibly desktop VTC endpoint) used by all assignees, and the PC port on it might be the connection for their laptop. In this case, it is best not to use sticky port security but to use a static mapping of authorized devices. Note: For Forescout, setting the \"Maximum connected endpoints per port\" to \"1\" does not prevent multiple MAC addresses from being connected. This setting will cause Forescout to ignore any switch port that has more than \"1\" MAC address connected. Enable this option to detect endpoints that are connected to the trunk ports of a managed switch. The plugin resolves and displays in the Console the switch properties of these connected endpoints, including the VLAN-related properties Switch Port VLAN, Switch Port VLAN Name, and Switch Port VLAN Change. To use this option, add the uplink port names of the managed switch in the \"Don’t learn on port names\" field. The plugin ignores learn events for those uplink ports. If needed for use of this option, modify the \"Maximum connected endpoints per port\" field to increase its value to allow plugin detection of multiple endpoints concurrently connected to the same switch port. The field’s default value is 10 (endpoints). The updated value must reflect the maximum number of endpoints that can be concurrently connected to the same port. This setting may hinder visibility for larger switches.","fixText":"Forescout has the ability to configure the amount of maximum connected endpoints per port.
