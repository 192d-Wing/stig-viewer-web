Authenticode technology and its underlying code signing mechanisms serve to provide a structure to identify software publishers and ensure that software applications have not been tampered with.

The manner in which the Authenticode technology validates a certificate and determines what is considered a valid certificate can be modified to meet the mission of the Microsoft Windows system. Each facade of certificate validation is controlled through the bits that makeup the hexadecimal value for the Authenticode setting.

New development projects should refrain from using .Net remoting capabilities whenever possible. .NET remoting provides the capability to build widely distributed applications. The application components may reside all on one computer or they may be spread out across the enclave. .NET client applications can make remoting calls to use objects in other processes on the same computer or on any other computer that is reachable over the network. .NET remoting can also be used to communicate with other application domains within the same process. Remoting is achieved via the exposure of endpoints that can be used to establish remote connectivity. Normally when application code attempts to access a protected resource, a stack walk is performed to ensure that all stack frames have permission to access the resource. However, with .Net 4.0, when a call is made on a remote object, this stack walk is not performed across the remoting boundary. The .Net remoting infrastructure requires FullTrust permission to execute on either the client or the server. Due to the fact that FullTrust permission is required, Remoting endpoints should be authenticated and encrypted in order to protect the system and the data. Microsoft provides three different \"channels\" that are used for remoting. They are HTTP, TCP, and IPC. Any unauthorized use of a remoting application provides unauthorized access with FullTrust permissions to the system.

There are numerous configuration files that affect different aspects of .Net behavior. The .NET config files are described below. Machine Configuration Files: The machine configuration file, Machine.config, contains settings that apply to an entire computer. This file is located in the %SYSTEMROOT%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Config directory for 32 bit .NET 4 installations and %SYSTEMROOT%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Config for 64 bit systems. Machine.config contains configuration settings for machine-wide assembly binding, built-in remoting channels, and ASP.NET. Application Configuration Files: Application configuration files contain settings specific to an application. If checking these files, a .NET review of a specific .NET application is most likely being conducted. These files contain configuration settings that the Common Language Runtime reads (such as assembly binding policy, remoting objects, and so on), and settings that the application can read. The name and location of the application configuration file depends on the application's host, which can be one of the following: Executable–hosted application configuration files. The configuration file for an application hosted by the executable host is in the same directory as the application. The name of the configuration file is the name of the application with a .config extension. For example, an application called myApp.exe can be associated with a configuration file called myApp.exe.config. Internet Explorer-hosted application configuration files. If an application hosted in Internet Explorer has a configuration file, the location of this file is specified in a tag with the following syntax. In this tag, \"location\" represents a URL that point to the configuration file. This sets the application base. The configuration file must be located on the same web site as the application. .NET 4.0 allows the CLR runtime to be configured to ignore FIPS encryption requirements.

New development projects should refrain from using .Net remoting capabilities whenever possible. .NET remoting provides the capability to build widely distributed applications. The application components may reside all on one computer or they may be spread out across the enclave. .NET client applications can make remoting calls to use objects in other processes on the same computer or on any other computer that is reachable over the network. .NET remoting can also be used to communicate with other application domains within the same process. Remoting is achieved via the exposure of endpoints that can be used to establish remote connectivity. Normally when application code attempts to access a protected resource, a stack walk is performed to ensure that all stack frames have permission to access the resource. However, with .Net 4.0, when a call is made on a remote object, this stack walk is not performed across the remoting boundary. The .Net remoting infrastructure requires FullTrust permission to execute on either the client or the server. Due to the fact that FullTrust permission is required, Remoting endpoints should be authenticated and encrypted in order to protect the system and the data. Microsoft provides three different \"channels\" that are used for remoting. They are HTTP, TCP, and IPC.
