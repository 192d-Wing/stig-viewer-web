To obtain an accurate time for itself, the forest root domain PDC Emulator acts as a client to an external time source. If the Windows Time service on the forest root domain PDC Emulator is not configured to acquire the time from a proper source, it may cause time service clients throughout the forest to operate with the inaccurate time setting. When a Windows computer operates with an inaccurate time setting, access to resources on computers with the accurate time might be denied. This is notably true when Kerberos authentication is utilized. Operation with an inaccurate time setting can reduce the value of audit data and invalidate it as a source of forensic evidence in an incident investigation.","fixText":"Configure the forest root PDC Emulator to acquire its time from an external time source.\n\nThe Windows Time Service can be configured by setting the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> System >> Windows Time Service >> Time Providers >> \"Configure Windows NTP Client\" to \"Enabled\", and configuring the \"NtpServer\" field to point to an authorized time server.","checkText":"This applies to the domain controller with the PDC Emulator role in forest root domain; it is NA for other domain controllers in the forest.\n\nDetermine the domain controller with the PDC Emulator role in the forest root domain:\n\nWindows 2016 or later: \n\nOpen \"Windows PowerShell\".\n\nEnter \"Get-ADDomain -Identity [Forest Root Domain] | FT PDCEmulator\", where [Forest Root Domain] is the forest root domain name, such as \"example.mil\".
