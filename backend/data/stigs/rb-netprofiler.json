The aggregation of log data kept on a syslog server can be used to detect attacks and trigger an alert to the appropriate security personnel. Upon gaining access to a network device, an attacker often attempts to create or change accounts to ensure continued access. Audit records and alerts with sufficient information to provide the information system security officer (ISSO) with forensic information about the incident can alert administrators to an ongoing attack attempt. The Riverbed NetProfiler audit log generates sufficient information by default to fulfill DOD requirements when the audit setting \"Log all Audit Events\" is selected. Sites may also fine-tune using the \"Log custom set of audit events\" and selecting applicable settings; however, this method may fail to capture all required audit records.

Network devices using encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules. FIPS 140-2/140-3 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules use authentication that meets DOD requirements. However, authentication algorithms must configure security processes to use only FIPS-approved and NIST-recommended authentication algorithms. Currently, HMAC is the only FIPS-validated algorithm for generating and verifying message/data authentication codes in accordance with FIPS 198-1. Products that are FIPS 140-2/140-3 validated will have an HMAC that meets specification; however, the option must be configured for use as the only message authentication code used for authentication to cryptographic modules. All protocols (e.g., SNMPv3, SSHv2, NTP, HTTPS, HMAC, password authentication, remote communications, password encryption, random number/session ID generation, and other protocols and cryptograph applications/functions that require server/client authentication) are to be FIPS 140-2/140-3 validated. Where SSH is used, the SSHv2 protocol suite is required because it includes Layer 7 protocols such as SCP and SFTP, which can be used for secure file transfers.
