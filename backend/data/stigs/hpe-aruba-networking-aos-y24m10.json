The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DOD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset or set of resources. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Some network devices are preconfigured with security groups. Other network devices enable operators to create custom security groups with custom permissions. For example, an information system security manager (ISSM) may require read-only access to audit the network device. Operators may create an audit security group, define permissions and access levels for members of the group, and then assign the ISSM's user persona to the audit security group. This is still considered privileged access, but the ISSM's security group is more restrictive than the network administrator's security group. Network devices that rely on authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) brokers for authentication and authorization services may need to identify the available security groups or access levels available on the network devices and convey that information to the AAA operator. Once the AAA broker identifies the user persona on the centralized directory service, the user's security group memberships can be retrieved. The AAA operator may need to create a mapping that links target security groups from the directory service to the appropriate security groups or access levels on the network device. Once these mappings are configured, authorizations can happen dynamically based on each user's directory service group membership.","fixText":"Configure AOS using the web interface:  \r\n \r\nNavigate to Configuration >> System >> Admin tab and expand the \"Admin Authentication Options\".  \r\n \r\nSelect root for the Default role.  \r\n \r\nCheck the \"Enable\" checkbox.  \r\n \r\nSelect the enterprise Server group that is configured for admin authorization.  \r\n \r\nClick Submit >> Pending Changes >> Deploy changes.","checkText":"Verify the AOS configuration using the web interface:  \r\n \r\nNavigate to Configuration >> System >> Admin tab and expand the \"Admin Authentication Options\".  \r\n \r\nIf root is not the Default role, \"Enable\" is not checked, or the Server group is not configured to the enterprise server group for admin authorization, this is a finding.","cciIds":["CCI-000213"],"status":"not_reviewed","findingDetails":"","comments":""},{"id":"SV-266910r1039751_rule","stigId":"V-266910","groupId":"V-266910","title":"DPMS Target HPE Aruba Networking AOS NDM","severity":"CAT II","description":"A mechanism to detect and prevent unauthorized communication flow must be configured or provided as part of the system design.

Valid factors include something the individual knows (e.g., username and password), something the individual has (e.g., a smart card or token), or something the individual is (e.g., a fingerprint or biometric). Legacy information system environments only use a single factor for authentication, typically a username and password combination. Although two pieces of data are used in a username and password combination, this is still considered single factor because an attacker can obtain access by learning what the user knows. Common attacks against single-factor authentication are attacks on user passwords. These attacks include brute force password guessing, password spraying, and password credential stuffing. MFA, along with strong user account hygiene, helps mitigate the threat of having account passwords discovered by an attacker. Even in the event of a password compromise, with MFA implemented and required for interactive login, the attacker still needs to acquire something the user has or replicate a piece of the user's biometric digital presence. Private industry recognizes and uses a wide variety of MFA solutions. However, DOD PKI is the only prescribed method approved for DOD organizations to implement MFA. For authentication purposes, centralized DOD certificate authorities (CA) issue PKI certificate key pairs (public and private) to individuals using the prescribed x.509 format. The private certificates that have been generated by the issuing CA are downloaded and saved to smart cards which, within DOD, are referred to as common access cards (CAC) or personal identity verification (PIV) cards. This happens at designated DOD badge facilities. The CA maintains a record of the corresponding public keys for use with PKI-enabled environments. Privileged user smart cards, or \"alternate tokens\", function in the same manner, so this requirement applies to all interactive user sessions (authorized and privileged users). Note: This requirement is used in conjunction with a centralized authentication server (e.g., Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting [AAA], Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service [RADIUS], Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAP]), a separate but equally important requirement. The MFA configuration of this requirement provides identification and the first phase of authentication (the challenge and validated response, thereby confirming the PKI certificate that was presented by the user). The centralized authentication server will provide the second phase of authentication (the digital presence of the PKI ID as a valid user in the requested security domain) and authorization. The centralized authentication server will map validated PKI identities to valid user accounts and determine access levels for authenticated users based on security group membership and role. In cases where the centralized authentication server is not used by the network device for user authorization, the network device must map the authenticated identity to the user account for PKI-based authentication.

However, there are many reasons a certificate may become invalid before the prescribed expiration date. For example, an employee may leave or be terminated and still possess the smartcard on which the PKI certificates were stored. Another example is that a smartcard containing PKI certificates may become lost or stolen. A more serious issue could be that the CA or server that issued the PKI certificates has become compromised, thereby jeopardizing every certificate keypair that was issued by the CA. These examples of revocation use cases and many more can be researched further using internet cybersecurity resources. PKI user certificates presented as part of the identification and authentication criteria (e.g., DOD PKI as multifactor authentication [MFA]) must be checked for validity by network devices. For example, valid PKI certificates are digitally signed by a trusted DOD CA. Additionally, valid PKI certificates are not expired, and valid certificates have not been revoked by a DOD CA. Network devices can verify the validity of PKI certificates by checking with an authoritative CA. One method of checking the status of PKI certificates is to query databases referred to as CRLs. These are lists that are published, updated, and maintained by authoritative DOD CAs. For example, once certificates are expired or revoked, issuing CAs place the certificates on a CRL. Organizations can download these lists periodically (i.e., daily or weekly) and store them locally on the devices themselves or onto another nearby local enclave resource. Storing them locally ensures revocation status can be checked even if internet connectivity is severed at the enclave's point of presence. However, CRLs can be large in storage size, and the use of CRLs can tax some computing resources. Another method of validating certificate status is to use the OCSP. Using OCSP, a requestor (i.e., the network device the user is trying to authenticate to) sends a request to an authoritative CA challenging the validity of a certificate that has been presented for identification and authentication. The CA receives the request and sends a digitally signed response indicating the status of the user's certificate as valid, revoked, or unknown. Network devices should only allow access for responses that indicate the certificates presented by the user were considered valid by an approved DOD CA. OCSP is the preferred method because it is fast, provides the most current status, and is lightweight.","fixText":"Configure AOS using the web interface:  \n \n1.
