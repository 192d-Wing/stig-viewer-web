The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. ALGs must use these policies and mechanisms to control access on behalf of the application for which it is acting as intermediary.","fixText":"Create the appropriate User Group(s) using the \"RBM Builder\".

Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems. Examples of information flow control restrictions include keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet or blocking information marked as classified but is being transported to an unapproved destination. ALGs enforce approved authorizations by employing security policy and/or rules that restrict information system services, provide packet filtering capability based on header or protocol information and/or message filtering capability based on data content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).","fixText":"Privileged Account User logon to the WebGUI >> Open the service to modified: From the Control Panel, select the type of service to be edited (e.g., Multi-Protocol Gateway) >> The list of available services will be displayed >> Click the name of the service to be edited (NOTE: this process is specific to a previously configured service in support of a defined use-case and addressing specific business and technical requirements).\r\n\r\nModify the service’s processing policy: Click the “…” button adjacent to the configured Processing Policy (in the case of a Web Service Proxy, click the “Policy” processing policy tab) >> The processing policy is displayed.\r\n \r\nSelect the rule to be edited by clicking the “Rule Name”.\r\n\r\nConfigure the Conditional Action: Drag the “Advanced” action to the desired point in the processing rule and double click it >> Select the “Conditional” action and click “Next” >> The “Configure Conditional Action” window is displayed >> A new rule is displayed, consisting of a “Match Condition” and an “Action”.\r\n\r\nPaste the XPath statement corresponding to the positive test condition (i.e., the condition that, if met, would allow the message to be processed) into the “Math Condition” field >> In the corresponding “Action”, select “Set Variable” >> Click “Create Action” >> The “Configure Set Variable Action” window is displayed >> In the Variable Name field, paste “service/routing-url” >> In the Viable Assignment field, enter the desired target URL (e.g., (http://somehost.com:port/someURI”) >> Click “Done”. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the rule that was just configured, a new rule is displayed, consisting of a “Match Condition” and an “Action”.\r\n \r\nPaste the XPath statement corresponding to the negative test condition (i.e., the condition that, if met, would result in the message being blocked) into the “Math Condition” field >> In the corresponding “Action”, select “Call Processing Rule” >> Click “Create Action” >> The “Configure Call Processing Rule Action” window is displayed >> From the “Processing Rule” drop-down list, select the name of the processing policy’s configured error rule >> Click “Done” >> Click “Done” >> Click “Apply Policy” >> Click “Close Window” >> Click the “Apply” button >> \r\nClick “Save Configuration”.","checkText":"Privileged Account User logon to the WebGUI >> Open the service to be modified: From the Control Panel, select the type of service to be edited (e.g., Multi-Protocol Gateway) >> The list of available services will be displayed >> Click the name of the service to be edited.\r\n\r\nVerify configuration of the processing policy: Click the “…” button adjacent to the configured Processing Policy (in the case of a Web Service Proxy, click the “Policy” processing policy tab) >> The processing policy is displayed >> Select the rule to be edited by clicking the “Rule Name” >> Double-click on the “Conditional” action.\r\n\r\nConfirm the XPath statement for the positive condition (i.e., the condition that, if met, would allow the message to be processed) would result in a “Set Variable” Action being triggered >> Click on the corresponding Set Variable action and confirm that the target URL is correct and that the variable being set is “service/routing-url” >> Click “Done”.\r\n\r\nConfirm the XPath statement for the negative condition (i.e., the condition that, if met, would result in the message being blocked) would result in a “Call Processing Rule” Action being triggered >> Click on the corresponding Call Processing Rule action and confirm that the service’s error rule is selected >> Click “Done” >> Click “Done” >> Click “Cancel” >> Click “Cancel”.\r\n\r\nIf any of the configuration conditions are not met, this is a finding.","cciIds":["CCI-001368"],"status":"not_reviewed","findingDetails":"","comments":""},{"id":"SV-79683r1_rule","stigId":"V-65193","groupId":"V-65193","title":"DPMS Target IBM DataPower XI52 ALG","severity":"CAT II","description":"Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network and between interconnected networks.

This results in unanticipated application behavior potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application. Network devices with the functionality to perform application layer inspection may be leveraged to validate data content of network communications. Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software typically follows well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If network elements use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.
