This can be checked using command \"show mls qos copp protocols\". \n\nStep 1: Verify traffic types have been classified based on importance levels. The following is an example configuration: \n\nclass-map match-all CoPP_CRITICAL \nmatch access-group name CoPP_CRITICAL \nclass-map match-any CoPP_IMPORTANT \nmatch access-group name CoPP_IMPORTANT \nmatch protocol arp \nclass-map match-all CoPP_NORMAL \nmatch access-group name CoPP_NORMAL \nclass-map match-any CoPP_UNDESIRABLE \nmatch access-group name CoPP_UNDESIRABLE \nclass-map match-all CoPP_DEFAULT \nmatch access-group name CoPP_DEFAULT \n\nStep 2: Review the access control lists (ACLs) referenced by the class-maps to determine if the traffic is being classified appropriately. The following is an example configuration: \n\nip access-list extended CoPP_CRITICAL \nremark our control plane adjacencies are critical \npermit ospf host [OSPF neighbor A] any \npermit ospf host [OSPF neighbor B] any \npermit pim host [PIM neighbor A] any \npermit pim host [PIM neighbor B] any \npermit pim host [RP addr] any \npermit igmp any 224.0.0.0 15.255.255.255 \npermit tcp host [BGP neighbor] eq bgp host [local BGP addr] \npermit tcp host [BGP neighbor] host [local BGP addr] eq bgp \ndeny ip any any \n\nip access-list extended CoPP_IMPORTANT \npermit tcp host [TACACS server] eq tacacs any \npermit tcp [management subnet] 0.0.0.255 any eq 22 \npermit udp host [SNMP manager] any eq snmp \npermit udp host [NTP server] eq ntp any \ndeny ip any any \n\nip access-list extended CoPP_NORMAL \nremark we will want to rate limit ICMP traffic \npermit icmp any any echo \npermit icmp any any echo-reply \npermit icmp any any time-exceeded \npermit icmp any any unreachable \ndeny ip any any \n\nip access-list extended CoPP_UNDESIRABLE \nremark other management plane traffic that should not be received \npermit udp any any eq ntp \npermit udp any any eq snmp\npermit tcp any any eq 22 \npermit tcp any any eq 23 \nremark other control plane traffic not configured on switch \npermit eigrp any any \npermit udp any any eq rip \ndeny ip any any \n\nip access-list extended CoPP_DEFAULT \npermit ip any any \n\nNote: Explicitly defining undesirable traffic with ACL entries enables the network operator to collect statistics. Excessive Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets can potentially monopolize Route Processor resources, starving other important processes. Currently, ARP is the only Layer 2 protocol that can be specifically classified using the match protocol command. \n\nStep 3: Review the policy-map to determine if the traffic is being policed appropriately for each classification. The following is an example configuration: \n\npolicy-map CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY \nclass CoPP_CRITICAL \npolice 512000 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action transmit \nclass CoPP_IMPORTANT \npolice 256000 4000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop \nclass CoPP_NORMAL \npolice 128000 2000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop \nclass CoPP_UNDESIRABLE \npolice 8000 1000 conform-action drop exceed-action drop \nclass CoPP_DEFAULT\npolice 64000 1000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop \n\nStep 4: Verify that the Control Plane Policing (CoPP) policy is enabled. The following is an example configuration: \n\ncontrol-plane \nservice-policy input CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY \n\nNote: Control Plane Protection (CPPr) can be used to filter as well as police control plane traffic destined to the RP. CPPr is very similar to CoPP and has the ability to filter and police traffic using finer granularity by dividing the aggregate control plane into three separate categories: 1) host, 2) transit, and 3) CEF-exception. Hence, a separate policy-map could be configured for each traffic category.\n\nIf the Cisco switch is not configured to protect against known types of DoS attacks by employing organization-defined security safeguards, this is a finding.","cciIds":["SV-110447","V-101343","CCI-002385"],"status":"not_reviewed","findingDetails":"","comments":""},{"id":"SV-220611r961812_rule","stigId":"V-220611","groupId":"V-220611","title":"DPMS Target Cisco IOS Switch NDM","severity":"CAT II","description":"Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
