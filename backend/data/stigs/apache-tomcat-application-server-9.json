When operating a Tomcat cluster, care must be taken to isolate the cluster traffic from untrusted sources.

The EncryptInterceptor adds encryption to the channel messages carrying session data between Tomcat cluster nodes. Place the element inside either the container or the container. Placing it in the engine means supporting clustering in all virtual hosts of Tomcat and sharing the messaging component.
