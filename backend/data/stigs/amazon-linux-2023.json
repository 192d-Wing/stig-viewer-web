Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For nonkernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles.

When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity. This requirement addresses the configuration of Amazon Linux 2023 to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.","fixText":"Configure Amazon Linux 2023 to use the AWS ALB rate limiting feature using its built-in rate limiting capabilities.
