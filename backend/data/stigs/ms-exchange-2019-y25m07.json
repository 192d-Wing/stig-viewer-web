Access to email services applications in the DOD requires authentication using DOD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates. Authentication for Outlook Web App (OWA) is used to enable web access to user email mailboxes and should assume that certificate-based authentication has been configured. This setting controls whether forms-based logon should be used by the OWA website. Because the DOD requires Common Access Card (CAC)-based authentication to applications, OWA access must be brokered through an application proxy or other preauthenticator, which performs CAC authentication prior to arrival at the CA server. The authenticated request is then forwarded directly to OWA, where authentication is repeated without requiring the user to repeat authentication steps. For this scenario to work, the Application Proxy server must have forms-based authentication enabled, and Exchange must have forms-based Authentication disabled. If forms-based Authentication is enabled on the Exchange CA server, it is evidence that the application proxy server is either not correctly configured, or it may be missing.","fixText":"Open the Exchange Management Shell and enter the following command:\n\nSet-OwaVirtualDirectory -Identity <'IdentityName'> -FormsAuthentication $false\n\nNote: <IdentityName> must be in quotes.\n\nExample for the Identity Name: <ServerName>\\owa (Default website)\n\nRestart the IIS service.","checkText":"Open the Exchange Management Shell and enter the following command:\n\nGet-OwaVirtualDirectory | Select-Object -Property ServerName, Name, Identity, *Authentication\n\nIf the value of \"FormsAuthentication\" is not set to \"False\", this is a finding.","cciIds":["CCI-000068"],"status":"not_reviewed","findingDetails":"","comments":""},{"id":"SV-259648r960780_rule","stigId":"V-259648","groupId":"V-259648","title":"DPMS Target Microsoft Exchange 2019 Mailbox Server","severity":"CAT II","description":"Unauthorized or malicious data changes can compromise the integrity and usefulness of the data.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

Each category may be set to one of four levels of logging: Lowest, Low, Medium, and High, depending on how much detail is required. Higher levels of detail require more disk space to store the audit material. Diagnostic logging is intended to help administrators debug problems with their systems, not as a general-purpose auditing tool.

When \"message tracking\" is enabled, only the sender, recipients, time, and other delivery information is included by default. Information such as the subject and message body is not included. However, the absence of the message subject line can make it difficult to locate a specific message in the log unless one knows roughly what time the message was sent. To simplify searches through these logs, Exchange offers the ability to include the message \"subject line\" in the log files and in the Message Tracking Center display. This can make it significantly easier to locate a specific message. However, this feature creates larger log files and will contain information that may raise privacy and legal concerns. Enterprise policy should be consulted before this feature is enabled. Also, because the log files may contain sensitive information in the form of the subject line, the log files will need to be protected, commensurate with the sensitivity level, as the content may be of interest to an attacker. For these reasons, it is recommended that subject logging not be enabled during regular production operations. Instead, treat this feature as a diagnostic that can be used if needed. The tradeoff is that finding the correct message in the message tracking logs will become more difficult because the administrator will need to search using only the time the message was sent and the message's sender.
