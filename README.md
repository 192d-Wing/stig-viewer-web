# stig-viewer-web

A web application for working with DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides
(STIGs): browsing the published catalog, editing checklists against your assets,
tracking findings through a review workflow, and exporting evidence in the
formats compliance teams actually need.

Not just a viewer — a full-stack compliance workflow platform.

## Features

**Catalog**
- Scheduled sync of STIG ZIPs from DISA, with XCCDF extraction and upsert into a
  Postgres catalog (see `backend/src/sync/`, `backend/stig-sources.toml`).
- Catalog search, diff between STIG versions, archive of superseded releases.
- CCI mapping panel.

**Checklists & authoring**
- Upload and view `.ckl` and XCCDF files.
- Rule list with CAT I/II/III severity filtering, rule detail, split-pane viewer,
  side-by-side diff between checklists.
- STIG writer with drafts and reviewer assignment.

**Assets**
- Asset library with groups, per-asset ACLs, baselines, checklist versions,
  snapshots, and bulk operations.
- Per-asset markdown runbooks.
- Scheduled asset email reports with CC lists.

**Workflow**
- Finding assignment and approvals, "my findings," stale and overdue tracking.
- Rule comments with @mentions and reactions.
- Saved searches.

**Exports**
- CKL, XCCDF, POAM, OSCAL, PDF compliance reports.
- Signed export bundles (Ed25519).

**Admin & governance**
- OIDC and SAML authentication.
- ABAC policies, session audit, audit retention.
- Rate limiting, backup/restore, admin console.

**Integrations**
- Outbound webhooks with HMAC signing and payload flavors (Slack, Teams, generic).
- Per-user notification preferences.

       Postgres 18

```

**Frontend** — `src/`, entry `stig-viewer.jsx`. React 19 with the AWS Cloudscape
design system, built with Vite 6. ESLint with `jsx-a11y`, `react-hooks`,
`no-unsanitized`, and `security` plugins; linter runs with `--max-warnings 0`.

**Backend** — `backend/`. Rust with Axum for HTTP, `sqlx` against Postgres,
`tokio` for async. XCCDF parser in `backend/src/parser/`, DISA sync and scheduler
in `backend/src/sync/`, API handlers in `backend/src/api/`. Migrations in
`backend/migrations/` (currently 35).

**Database** — Postgres 18. Managed through `sqlx` migrations.

**Auth** — Keycloak in local dev (realm pre-seeded under `dev/keycloak/`),
pluggable OIDC or SAML in production.

**Tests** — `e2e/` holds the Playwright suite (~79 specs) covering auth, library,
writer, workflow, exports, dashboards, trends, severity, baselines, PDF report,
audit, ABAC, and webhooks.

## Running locally

Everything is wired through `docker-compose.yml`. You need Docker (or Podman with
a compose shim) and nothing else.

```bash
docker compose up
```

That brings up four services:

| Service   | Port | Notes                                                  |
|-----------|------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| frontend  | 5173 | Vite dev server, hot-reload                            |
| backend   | 8080 | `cargo watch` on `src/` and `migrations/`              |
| postgres  | 5433 | Mapped off the default to avoid clashes; user `stig`   |
| keycloak  | 8081 | Dev realm `stig-viewer`, admin `admin` / `admin`       |

Open http://localhost:5173 and sign in through Keycloak.

### Environment overrides

The compose file reads a handful of variables from the shell; defaults are fine
for local work. The ones you may want to change:

- `VITE_API_URL` — backend origin baked into the frontend bundle. Set when the
  backend isn't on `localhost:8080` (for example when developing from a second
  machine).
- `OIDC_INTERNAL_URL` / `OIDC_PUBLIC_URL` / `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` /
  `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` / `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` — point the backend at a different
  identity provider. `INTERNAL` is how the backend reaches the IdP; `PUBLIC` is
  how the browser does.
- `STIG_SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS` — hours between DISA sync runs. Set to a large
  number to effectively disable the sync (CI does this to keep startup fast).
- `ALLOW_TEST_AUTH_HEADER` — enables the `X-User-Id` test bypass. Must stay
  unset in production; the backend additionally refuses it when
  `STIG_ENV=production`.

### Database

Postgres data lives in a named volume (`postgres_data`). Migrations apply on
backend start. To reset:

```bash
docker compose down -v   # drops the volume
docker compose up
```

### Frontend-only development

If you want to iterate on the frontend against a running backend without
rebuilding node_modules in the container:

```bash
npm install
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm run dev
```

### Lint and tests

```bash
npm run lint         # frontend ESLint, zero warnings
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright suite (requires the stack running)
cd backend && cargo test
cd backend && cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```
